# PyHasher
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyHasher is a small CustomTkinter project I built to get more comfortable designing user interfaces in Python.

It features:
- Common hash functions (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) for both strings and files
- Simple AES-based string encryption/decryption
- A basic password generator with customizable length and character types
- Utility to strip metadata from files (PNG metadata removed even without Pillow)
- Option to save file metadata to a text file

This was mainly a learning project, but it's fully functional and self-contained, thanks for checking it out!
